The '''Vikings''' were the people who came from [[Scandinavia]] ([[Denmark]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]]) from about AD 700 to about 1125. This period is called the [[Viking Age]].{{efn|The dating of the 'Viking Age' depends on the location and how the term is used. Generally it is from about 700/800 to about 1030/1100 (later for some purposes\u2013). In Ireland, the Viking age was from about 825\u2013885 and 910\u2013999. In France from about 834\u2013890 and in Southern England from the 840s\u2013910. In studying Vikings and their religion, the dates of the Viking Age are from about 8001300.}} Vikings traveled great distances in their [[longship]]s, as [[:wikt:trader|traders]], [[settler]]s and [[warrior]]s. Many of the Vikings were tall and had red or blonde hair and [[beard]]s.{{efn|Scandinavians typically were of mixed hair color; natural red hair color being roughly between 5-10% of the people who lived there. But men used the same harsh [[Sodium hydroxide|lye soaps]] as women did that had a bleaching effect making their hair and beards reddish blonde to blonde.Mary Wilhelmine Williams, ''Social Scandinavia in the Viking Age'' (New York: Macmillan, 1920), p. 80\u201383</ref>}} Villages on or near any coast in early [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Europe]] lived in great fear of Viking attacks. Some of the countries most affected by Viking [[piracy]] were [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]], [[Germany]] and [[France]].== Language ==Some words from the Scandinavian and Viking language ([[Norse]]) entered the English language. For example, the words ''skirt'' and ''shirt'' came from the word ''skyrta'', meaning a tunic. As English changed, the semantics altered to give us the separate words 'skirt' and 'shirt' we know today. ''Skin'' came from the Norse word ''skinn'' (which meant to strip the meat off something). Some place-names in the areas the Vikings conquered are still in use. For example in [[Yorkshire]] places ending with ''-thwaite'' meant a ''clearing'', and ''dale'' which meant a ''valley''. The word ''thorpe'' meant ''new village'', such as [[Scunthorpe]]. The girls' name Leah, came from the word [[leya]] and was used for Viking girls.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}== Exploration == The Vikings traveled through [[Russia]], the [[Mediterranean Sea]], southern Europe, northern [[Africa]] and south-western [[Asia]]. Some Vikings sailed across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] via [[Iceland]] and [[Greenland]] and may have explored places in [[North America]]. The ruins of a Viking settlement have been found at [[L'Anse-aux-Meadows]], [[Newfoundland]]. [[Archaeologists]] used [[radiocarbon dating]] to find out how old the settlement was. Their tests gave them a range of dates from about AD 700 to about AD 1000.== Vikings in Europe ==Europeans were frightened of the Vikings because of their strong [[weapon]]s, swift [[attack]]s, and cruel fighting tactics. They were known for their bad treatment of [[Woman|women]], [[child]]ren and [[monk]]s in the places where they fought. When the Vikings came to England, the English kings paid them to leave the [[country]], but the Vikings took their money and sometimes fought them anyway. These payments were called [[Danegeld]]. From the [[9th century]] to [[1066]], when the French [[Duke of Normandy]], who became [[King William I]] of England [[conquer]]ed it, Danish and Norwegian Vikings ruled large parts of England.Because of their [[longship]]s, which could float in 4 feet (1.3m) of water, the Vikings were able to make their way up [[river]]s and land deep inside a country. For example they sailed up the [[River Shannon]] in Ireland and built a [[harbour]] 60 miles (100 km) from the [[coast]].There was a difference in who led Viking raids. In the 9th century Viking Age raids were led by men who may have been [[exile]]s in their own countries. The later Viking raids in the late [[10th century]] and early [[11th century]] and were led by [[King]]s. Some of the early leaders tried to become kings with the riches they plundered from Europe and Russia. Some were successful but most were not.== In Russia and the Mediterranean ==The Vikings were called [[Rus]] by the peoples [[east]] of the [[Baltic Sea]]. The name Russia is from the name Rus, the Vikings who settled in [[Kiev]] and formed the first Russian state. The Vikings, or Rus, who served the [[Byzantine]] [[Emperor]]s were called [[Varangians]]. They became the personal [[bodyguard]]s to the Emperor and were called the [[Varangian Guard]].== Related pages ==* [[Viking Age]]* [[Kievan Rus']]* [[Varangians]]== Notes =={{notelist}}==References=={{reflist}}== Other websites =={{commonscat|Vikings}}* [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/vikings/ BBC: History of Vikings]* [http://www.lofotr.no/engelsk/index.htm Borg Viking museum, Norway]* [http://www.viking.no/ The Viking Network]* [http://www.uib.no/jais/v003ht/03-001-025Montgom1.htm Ibn Fadlan and the Rusiyyah, by James E.
